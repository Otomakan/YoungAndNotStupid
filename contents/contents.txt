								        <time>london<br></time> FIRST BOOK - Probably nothing fancy, a few colours to spark my imagination and initiate the beggining of a long love story. From fiction to political sciences and economy, I need my fix to dream, learn and escape.

								        <time>paris<br></time> STUDY TIME - If books were fun, school ... not as much. Despite a passion for learning, critical thinking, and solving problems I couldn't find a fit until my 2nd year of university where I found creativity and hard work were not incompatible.

My future was getting drawn more and more clearly, my PhD was waiting for me then a career as an academic or consulting lawyer. But then...

												<time>startup world<br></time> BUILDING - I couldn't have dreamt of a more amazing yet nerve wracking experience. I had more experiences that I could dream ofmet more diverse people than I could have in a different career, I learned more skills than one should have to. Success is more than money and I am lucky that
												I can also gained pride from continuously being part of meaningful projects.

What I can do

In business being a Jack of all trade can be as much as a strenght as it can be a weakness. As an entrepreneur I have learned that you need to have a strong foundations of most aspect of  running a company: sales, product development, marketing, strategy, social media, legal, market research, networking, project management, supply chain... Of course I am not great at all of these far from it. 



Instead of using an example of what I'm good at I'll take an example of what I'm bad at so hopefully you'll understand what I am good at. 

Leveraging Talents

Social media development is and has been a weak spot of mine. When I first came to that realisation I did what I know I am good at : research and connections. I read a lot about what has to be done and I asked people a lot of questions. I reached out to social media specialist on twitter, blogs, I attended networking events, meetups, I asked people in my network. This all helped in the learning phase. Then for the design phase I was ready to build a rough strategy by myself, and finally I could ask some of the people I helped in the past to help me refine that strategy. 

Knowing when to give up// swallow up pride// kill babies// Knowing when to say stop

I had a good plan, a good strategy and yet it didn't work out. As we were starting out and putting things into place it become increasingly clear that implementation was going to be an issue. I did not have the time to create on regular basis the required content and perform the required tasks to properly carry out the plan, nor did I have time to learn how to do them better and more efficiently. After all this work I had to change something if I didn’t want to waste more time. 

Identifying Value Points 

At this stage I decided  we had to refocus our customer acquisition and build branding strategy to make more efficient use of our time.  It became clear to me that for our type of business, and our target market social media was a good way but not the most efficient way to acquire clients or build a reputation. A strong social media presence would have been the icing on the cake but it would have been the 80% of the work that brings 20% of the value. 

Play with what I am good at 

I have good interpersonal skills and writing abilities. So instead of reaching out to the masses I decided to focus on reaching out to people, to individuals. The energy industry in Australia has a lot of different players but people it has characteristics of a community, a lot of of the business is made by word to mouth. My assumption was then that to build a reputation we needed to  make yourself known to key institutions. To make ourselves a name I thought that  by building quality relations with people and leverging our fun start up mentality, implacable presentation and strong integrity. 



After months of work one day I realised that I succeeded. That day, we were talking to one of the largest utilities company in the country for the first time. The person I was talking to let's call him Bob told me at the end of the meeting “By the way you guys at Manage My Power have been working with other people in our state, haven’t you?”. We told him “We are not sure”, Bob replied “Yeah, I think you did because I heard your name before”. The truth is he was the first person in that State we talked to!  

Result over method

I am not sure that with a pure social media strategy Bob would have heard of us. Before the Bob episode I was starting to think that with our old-fashion methods we were getting clients but weren’t really helping us building a brand. After that I realised that we actually were able to build a “brand” with very limited internet presence and close to zero advertising.  The lesson I learned is that it doesn't matter if you can't do something, I want find creative ways to reach the same results. It was difficult for a millennial like me to accept that social media was not the way to go. Sometimes to be creative you have to go against your times and take a step back!

Not really not a step back but using old fashion method with modern tools.

HOBBIES



Where I go

My objective is to participate to meaningul projects, and build things that are able to live on and continue independantly from me. I now want to bring Manage My Power and Goodness Triangle in different countries. There are different reasons to it. First is a business decision, I know that my business partners can continue running the business properly without me. Second it is to fulfill my need for adventure. I am luky enough not to be bound by a mortgage, family obligations or financial duress. Thus, I want to be able to grow by eperimenting and building relations in different cultures and environment. This will allow me to grow 
There are no geographical limitations. 

I want to cntinue being where I think I can bring in more value. Maybe now is also a good time to bring to a company some of thatentrepreneurial spirit that can sometimes be lacking in some places. 

How to get there

As they say there are many roads to Rome. After, such wonderful succesful experiences as an entrepreneur it is sometimes a bit difficult to admit that the corporate world has something to offer to you. But I definitely think it does, to be a good manager you need to be managed by the best. 

I want my businesses to have a unique models that can lead to optimal results. I can experiment in the void, but I believe that there is a leap to be made from the pure startup culture in order to become more profitable. I ant to experiment what a well functioning corporate structure is like. 

 
How I live

				        <time>NEW YORK</time> BIRTH - Coming from the union of an international it was only natural that
								developped a love for languages, cultures and travels. Inspired at a young age I strongly started to
								believe in a world of endless possibilities, opportunities.
				      </div>
				    </li>
				    <li>
				      <div>
				        <time>london</time> FIRST BOOK - Probably nothing fancy, a few colors to spark the imagination and initiate
								the beggining of a long love story. From fiction to political sciences and economy, I need my fix to dream, learn and escape.
				      </div>
				    </li>
				    <li>
				      <div>
				        <time>paris</time> STUDY TIME - If books were fun, school ... not as much. Despite a passion for learning, critical thinking, and solving problems
								I couldn't find a fit until my 2nd year of university where I found creativity and hard work were not incompatible.
				      </div>
				    </li>
				    <li>
				      <div>
				        <time>wakiso</time> GROWTH - The transition from  boy to  man happened to me when I granbbed responsibilities. I could finally
								feel like I was putting my wor to accomplish meaningful projects.
				      </div>
				    </li>
				    <li>
				      <div>
				        <time>melbourne I</time> DISCOVERY - Still in a academic context but ready for more than an adventure, a new life that
								I had to build from scratch and could shape to my will. My future was getting drawn more and more clearly, my PhD was waiting for me
								then a career as an academic or consulting lawyer. But then...

				      </div>
				    </li>
				    <li>
				      <div>
				        <time>melbourne II</time> BUILDING - ... My love for innovation technology and adventure took over me. I wanted to build something meaningful
								something I could be proud of before I could rest in the comfortable arms of stability.

								<time>startup world</time> BUILDING - I couldn't have dreamt of a more amazing yet nerve wracking experience. I had more experiences that I could dream of
								met more diverse people than I could have in a different career, I learned more skills than one should have to. Success is more than money and I am lucky that
								I can also gained pride from continuously being part of meaninngful projects.
